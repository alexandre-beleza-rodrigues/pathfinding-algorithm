# Pathfinding Algorithm

This project is an example of the A* pathfinding algorithm. You can find more information about this algorithm in this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). But basicly is the most pupular pathfinding algorithm and instead of searching all the nodes to find the shortest path to the goal, it starts to search the nodes that are in the direction of the destination witch also makes it an informed search algorithm.

To test this demo just clone this repo, install the requirements in "requirement.txt", and run "python main.py" in the project directory.
The commands are:
- left click: add start, goal and walls
- right click: delete any of the above
- space: run the algorithm/demo
- c: clean all / restart

For this projecty I took A LOT of inspiration from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=2147s).
